In this guide, you will learn about testing your application on platform specific emulators and devices.
By the end of this guide, you should understand:

* How to launch your application with the iPhone & Android emulators
* How to install and launch your application on iPhone & Android devices
* How to output log messages to the Titanium Developer console
* How to adjust log levels within Titanium Developer
</summary>

#Overview

The main focus of this guide will center around the **Test & Package** tab of Titanium Developer.  You will use the **Run Emulator** & **Run on Device** sections of this tab to test your application.

#Platform SDKs

Before you can test or deploy with the various mobile platforms you will need to download & install their specific software development kits (SDKs).  Below are links to the supported platform SDKs:

* iPhone (iOS) - [http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action](http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action)
* Android - [http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

<note>
The iOS setup is straightforward.  No further configuration should be required beyond installing the Xcode and iOS SDK.

NOTE: iPhone (iOS) development is only supported on Mac OS X.
</note>

<note>
Android SDK setup is a bit more complicated.  After you've downloaded the SDK you can follow the installation guide found [here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html).  Pay particular attention to the [Adding Platforms and Other Components](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html#AddingComponents) section.  You'll need to install at least 1 version of the **Platform SDK** (typically the latest one) as well as the **Google APIs by Google Inc** 3rd Party add-on.
</note>

Once you have completed the Android configuration noted earlier you'll also need to tell Titanium Developer where the SDK is located.  You do this by selected the **Profile** perspective and updating the **Android SDK** value under **Environment Settings**.

You can verify the SDKs are properly configured by looking for the green checkmark indicators on the **New Project** screen:

#Getting Started

With the mobile platform SDKs in place you are ready to move on with testing.  Get started by performing the following steps:
    
    1.  Launch Titanium Developer
    2.  Create a new project or select a pre-existing project
    3.  Select the Test & Package tab

<note>
The auto-generated project created via **New Project** is actually a working skeleton application.  You can use this to experiment with the various testing options even if you don't have a project of your own to play with yet.
</note>

#Run Emulator

On the **Test & Package** tab there are currently two options to choose from; iPhone & Android.  Select the platform you would like to test on.

![Run Emulator](http://developer.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/documentation-examples/run_emulator.png "Run Emulator")

##Emulator Options

After selecting the platform to test you just need set the options for the test and click **Launch**.  For the most part the options presented for each emulator are the same.

* **SDK**: Used to select the version of the platform SDK to test with
* **Filter**: Used to select the level of log information to display in the Titanium Developer console as the application is running.  This can be adjusted while the emulator is running as well.
* **Screen**: This is an Android only option.  Just as it sounds, this options allows you select the type of screen to test on.
* **Launch**: Starts the emulator
* **Stop**: Stops the emulator

**iPhone Emulator Options**:

**Android Emulator Options**:

Below is an example of what you should expect to see after successfully launching each of the emulators.

#Run on Device

To test your application on a physical device perform the following steps:

    1.  Connect the device you'll be installing the application on via USB
    2.  Select the corresponding mobile platform on the Test & Package tab
    3.  Click the Install Now button (see additional notes below)
    4.  Launch/Test your application on the device
    
<note>
Android doesn't require any additional setup beyond what was discussed earlier.

To install an application on an iOS device you must first complete a series of steps required by Apple (e.g.) register iPhone, obtain developer certificate, etc.  These steps are outlined on the **iPhone** sub tab of the **Run on Device** tab.  A screenshot of these steps is displayed below.
</note>

#Logging

Titanium offers a number of logging options that will prove useful as you develop your applications.  Use these to dump out information during interesting moments of time within your application as needed.

<code type="javascript">
Ti.API.info(message); //information messages
Ti.API.error(message); //error messages
Ti.API.debug(message); //debug messages
Ti.API.warn(message); //warning messages
</code>

Review the console output to aid with debugging as you develop:

Review the [Titanium.API docs](http://developer.appcelerator.com/apidoc/mobile/latest/Titanium.API-module) for more information.

#Beta testing iOS applications Ad-Hoc

Since Titanium Developer 1.3 it's possible to use the generated Xcode project to create an Ad Hoc beta version of your application.

##1. Add devices to the Provisioning Portal

You will need the device name's and UDID's from the iOS devices the application will run on. An easy way to get those information is to ask your beta testers to install [Ad Hoc Helper](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=285691333&mt=8 "iTunes link") on their device. This application will generate an email containing the information you need.
Now go to section **Devices** in the Provisioning Portal, click on the button **Add devices** and add the devices.

##2. Generate a Development Provisioning Profile

In order for the iOS devices to be able to run the application, they need to be in the Development Provisioning Profile you've used to build the application.
In the section **Provisioning**, go to the tab **Development** and click on the button **New profile**. Now select the devices you want your application to run on and click on the **Submit** button.
Refresh your browser until the status field reads **Active**. Now click the **Download** button and save the file to disk.

##3. Add the Provisioning Profile to your project

In Titanium Developer and go to the **Run on Device** tab. Under *Select Provisioning Profile*, select the profile you've saved to disk.
This will start Xcode and ask you to add the profile to your Library. Confirm this.

##4. Create the binary for your testers

1.  Create a new folder in Finder (e.g. **Ad Hoc**)
2.  In this folder, create another folder called **Payload** (case-sensitive)
3.  Copy your 512x512px appicon as **iTunesArtwork** (without extension) to the Ad Hoc folder (optional)
4.  Double-click the **.xcodeproj** in the *build/iphone* folder of your project
5.  In Xcode, select **Release** as the Active Configuration
6.  In the menu, select **Build** > **Clean All Targets**
7.  Select **Build** > **Build**
8.  Right-click your project in the *Groups & Files* section and select *Reveal in Finder*
9.	Navigate to the *iphone/build/Release-iphoneos/* folder
10.	This folder contains three files *MyApp*, *MyApp.ipa* and *MyApp.app.dSYM*
11.	Copy MyApp (the file without extension) to the Payload folder

Once you've completed above steps, navigate to the Ad Hoc folder in your **Terminal.app**. Now bundle the app using the following command:

<code>
	zip -r MyApp.ipa iTunesArtwork Payload
</code>

<note>
	The command-line **zip** utility is required as the default OSX archiver adds certain files to the archive, which makes Windows iTunes users unable to install the beta on their device.
</note>

##5. Distribute the application to your beta testers

Send the *.ipa* file you've created in the previous step along with the *.mobileprovision* file you've used to build the application, to your beta testers. To install the application on device, beta-testers now need to perform the following steps:

1. Drag the .mobileprovision file to the Library section in iTunes
2. Double-click the .ipa file to add it to iTunes
3. Sync an iOS device to install the application
